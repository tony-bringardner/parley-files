# parley-files

> parley-files is part of **Parley**, a family of Java libraries for implementing internet protocols.
> It was previously `us.bringardner:bjl_file_system` (BjlFileSystem), with packages under
> `us.bringardner.io.filesource`. Moving over means changing the dependency, replacing
> `us.bringardner.io.filesource` with `us.bringardner.parley.files` in imports, and renaming any
> `META-INF/services/us.bringardner.io.filesource.FileSourceFactory` registration file to
> `META-INF/services/us.bringardner.parley.files.FileSourceFactory`.

**FileSource** is an interface that looks very much like `java.io.File`, but lets many implementations (local disk, in-memory, FTP, SFTP, a database, …) coexist in one program. Application code works with `FileSource` and doesn't need to know at compile time which kind of file system it's talking to.

The syntax deliberately stays close to `java.io.File`, so moving code between the two takes little effort.

- One API for local files, in-memory files and remote file systems
- Implementations are discovered at runtime with `ServiceLoader` and chosen by a short type id
- Files can be addressed by URL (`filesource:/path?sourcetype=memory`)
- Random access (`IRandomAccessStream`) and seekable input streams
- A `java.nio.file` provider, so `Files.readString`, `Files.newDirectoryStream(dir, "*.txt")` and friends work on any FileSource

## Requirements

- Java 11 or later
- [parley-core](https://github.com/tony-bringardner/parley-core) and [parley-io](https://github.com/tony-bringardner/parley-io) (pulled in automatically by Maven)

## Installation

The artifacts are published to GitHub Packages:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>us.bringardner.parley</groupId>
    <artifactId>parley-files</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Add the package repositories to your `pom.xml` (parley-core and parley-io are published from their own repositories):

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>github</id>
        <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/tony-bringardner/parley-files</url>
    </repository>
    <repository>
        <id>github-parley-core</id>
        <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/tony-bringardner/parley-core</url>
    </repository>
    <repository>
        <id>github-parley-io</id>
        <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/tony-bringardner/parley-io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

GitHub Packages requires authentication even for public packages. Create a personal access token with the `read:packages` scope, and add a `<server>` entry for each repository id to `~/.m2/settings.xml`:

```xml
<servers>
    <server>
        <id>github</id>
        <username>YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME</username>
        <password>YOUR_TOKEN</password>
    </server>
    <!-- repeat for github-parley-core and github-parley-io -->
</servers>
```

## Quick start

```java
FileSourceFactory factory = FileSourceFactory.getDefaultFactory();   // local files

FileSource dir = factory.createFileSource("/tmp/example");
dir.mkdirs();

FileSource file = dir.getChild("hello.txt");
try (OutputStream out = file.getOutputStream()) {
    out.write("Hello, FileSource".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
}

for (FileSource f : dir.listFiles()) {
    System.out.println(f.getName() + "  " + f.length() + " bytes");
}

try (InputStream in = file.getInputStream()) {
    System.out.println(new String(in.readAllBytes(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
}
```

All `FileSource` objects are created by a `FileSourceFactory`. Everything else (`getChild`, `getParentFile`, `listFiles`, `exists`, `mkdirs`, `delete`, `renameTo`, permissions, times, …) works much as it does on `java.io.File`. To convert existing code, see [Migrating from File to FileSource](#migrating-from-file-to-filesource).

## Implementations

Built in:

| Type id | Class | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `fileproxy` | `FileProxyFactory` / `FileProxy` | Local files, backed by `java.io.File` and `java.nio.file`. The default. |
| `memory` | `MemoryFileSourceFactory` / `MemoryFileSource` | A virtual file system held in memory. Handy for tests. Thread-safe. |

Separate projects, which plug in the same way once they're on the classpath. They are being
moved to Parley as `parley-files-ftp`, `parley-files-sftp` and `parley-files-jdbc`; the versions below
still work with `bjl_file_system`:

| Project | Artifact | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| [BjlFileSystemFtp](https://github.com/tony-bringardner/BjlFileSystemFtp) | `bjl_file_system_ftp` | FTP servers |
| [BjlFileSystemSftp](https://github.com/tony-bringardner/BjlFileSystemSftp) | `bjl_file_system_sftp` | SSH/SFTP servers |
| [BjlFileSystemJdbc](https://github.com/tony-bringardner/BjlFileSystemJdbc) | `bjl_file_system_jdbc` | A file system stored in a database, via JDBC |

Each is published to GitHub Packages from its own repository, so add a matching `<repository>` (and `<server>` entry) as in [Installation](#installation).

### Choosing an implementation at runtime

```java
FileSourceFactory memory = FileSourceFactory.getFileSourceFactory("memory");
memory.connect();
FileSource scratch = memory.createFileSource("/scratch/data.bin");

String[] available = FileSourceFactory.getRegisterdFactories();   // e.g. [fileproxy, memory]
```

Remote factories take their connection settings (host, user, …) through `setConnectionProperties(...)` or `connect(Properties)`; `getConnectProperties()` lists what a factory needs.

To change the default factory for the whole program, set the system property `-DFileSource.default=<type id>`, or call `FileSourceFactory.setDefaultFactory(...)`.

## URLs

Any FileSource can be addressed by a `filesource:` URL. The `sourcetype` parameter names the factory:

```java
FileSource f = FileSourceFactory.getFileSource("filesource:/tmp/example/hello.txt?sourcetype=fileproxy");

URL url = scratch.toURL();   // e.g. filesource:/scratch/data.bin?sourcetype=memory&sessionId=0
try (InputStream in = url.openStream()) {
    ...
}
```

The `sessionId` parameter ties a URL to an existing connected factory, so a memory file's URL resolves to the same in-memory file system. Loading the library registers the URL handler. If your application server (or another library) has already installed a `URLStreamHandlerFactory`, the handler is registered through `java.protocol.handler.pkgs` instead.

## Random access

```java
IRandomAccessStream ra = file.getRandomAccessStream("rw");
try {
    ra.seek(7);
    ra.write("filesource".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
} finally {
    ra.close();
}
```

`IRandomAccessStream` has the same methods as `java.io.RandomAccessFile` (`seek`, `getFilePointer`, `read`, `readFully`, `readInt`, `writeUTF`, `setLength`, …). For read-only access with seeking, use `getSeekableInputStream()`.

## NIO file system provider

`file.toPath()` returns a `java.nio.file.Path` (a `FileSourcePath`) for any FileSource. The provider is registered for the `filesource` scheme, so `Paths.get(URI)` works too:

```java
Path path = file.toPath();
String text = Files.readString(path);
Files.writeString(path.resolveSibling("copy.txt"), text);

try (DirectoryStream<Path> ds = Files.newDirectoryStream(dir.toPath(), "*.txt")) {
    for (Path p : ds) {
        System.out.println(p.getFileName());
    }
}

Path fromUri = Paths.get(new URI("filesource:/tmp/example/hello.txt?sourcetype=fileproxy"));
```

Supported: streams and byte channels (`readAllBytes`, `readString`, `lines`, `write`, `newByteChannel`), the standard open options, `copy`, `move`, `delete`, `createDirectory`, `exists`/`notExists`/`isReadable`, basic, POSIX and owner attributes (read with `readAttributes`, set with `setAttribute` or the typed setters), symbolic and hard links (`createSymbolicLink`, `createLink`, `readSymbolicLink`), directory streams, file stores, a user/group lookup service, and `glob:`/`regex:` path matchers. Not supported: `FileChannel` and `AsynchronousFileChannel`, watch services (`newWatchService` throws `UnsupportedOperationException`), and `ATOMIC_MOVE`.

For remote file systems the lookup service only knows the connected user and that user's groups, and a file store's space figures are 0 because the size isn't known (as `java.io.File` reports); local files use the operating system's lookup and report real disk space.

## Writing your own implementation

1. Implement `FileSource` for your storage, and extend `FileSourceFactory`. The factory's `getTypeId()` is the id used in URLs and `getFileSourceFactory(...)`. The factory needs a public no-argument constructor.
2. If you support random access, return a `FileSourceRandomAccessStream` from `getRandomAccessStream(mode)`. For remote storage, `AbstractRandomAccessIoController` handles chunked reads and writes for you.
3. Register the factory in `META-INF/services/us.bringardner.parley.files.FileSourceFactory` (see [`resources/META-INF/services`](resources/META-INF/services) in this project):

   ```
   com.example.MyFileSourceFactory
   ```

The unit tests in `src/test/java`, starting with `AbstractTestClass`, are the best worked examples of what an implementation has to support.

## Migrating from File to FileSource

`FileSource` was designed to look like `java.io.File`, so most of a migration is mechanical: create files through a factory instead of `new File(...)`, change `File` to `FileSource` in your types, and replace `FileInputStream`/`FileOutputStream` with the file's own streams. Once that's done, the same code works on local files, in memory, or on an FTP/SFTP/JDBC file system, depending only on which factory created the `FileSource`.

### Step by step

1. **Get a factory once**, where your code decides where files live, and pass it (or a starting `FileSource`) down:

   ```java
   FileSourceFactory factory = FileSourceFactory.getDefaultFactory();   // local files, as before
   ```

2. **Replace `new File(...)`.** A path becomes `factory.createFileSource(path)`, and a child becomes `parent.getChild(name)`. Relative paths are resolved against `factory.getCurrentDirectory()`, which for local files is the process's working directory, as with `java.io.File`.

3. **Change `File` to `FileSource`** in fields, parameters and return types. Start at the lowest-level methods and work outward; see [Mixing both during a migration](#mixing-both-during-a-migration) to convert at the edges while you go.

4. **Handle `IOException`.** Unlike `java.io.File`, methods such as `exists()`, `isDirectory()`, `length()`, `listFiles()` and `getParentFile()` declare `IOException`, because on a remote file system each one may be a network call. Most methods that used a `File` already throw `IOException`, so usually this only means adding `throws IOException` to a few more signatures.

5. **Replace the stream classes** as in the table below.

### Equivalents

| `java.io.File` code | `FileSource` code |
|---|---|
| `new File("/data/in.txt")` | `factory.createFileSource("/data/in.txt")` |
| `new File(dir, "in.txt")` | `dir.getChild("in.txt")` |
| `file.getParentFile()`, `getName()`, `getParent()`, `getAbsolutePath()`, `getCanonicalPath()` | Same names |
| `file.getPath()`, `isAbsolute()`, `getAbsoluteFile()`, `getCanonicalFile()` | Same names (a `FileSource` is always absolute, so `getPath()` is the absolute path and `isAbsolute()` is true) |
| `exists()`, `isFile()`, `isDirectory()`, `isHidden()`, `length()`, `lastModified()` | Same names (they declare `IOException`) |
| `mkdir()`, `mkdirs()`, `createNewFile()`, `delete()` | Same names |
| `list()`, `listFiles()` | Same names |
| `listFiles(FileFilter)`, `list(FilenameFilter)` | `listFiles(FileSourceFilter)`, `list(FileSourceFilter)`; a lambda works, e.g. `dir.listFiles(f -> f.getName().endsWith(".log"))` |
| `canRead()`, `canWrite()`, `canExecute()`, `setReadable(...)`, `setWritable(...)`, `setExecutable(...)`, `setReadOnly()` | Same names, plus per-class ones such as `setGroupWritable(...)` and `canOtherRead()` |
| `file.setLastModified(time)` | Same name (or `setLastModifiedTime(time)`) |
| `file.renameTo(dest)` | `file.renameTo(dest)`, where `dest` is a `FileSource` from the same factory. It never replaces an existing file (see [Behaviour worth knowing](#behaviour-worth-knowing)). |
| `File.listRoots()` | `factory.listRoots()` |
| `File.separatorChar`, `File.pathSeparatorChar` | `factory.getSeperatorChar()`, `factory.getPathSeperatorChar()` |
| `file.toURI()`, `file.toURL()` | Same names; they give a [`filesource:` URI/URL](#urls) that works for every implementation |
| `file.toPath()` | Same name; the `Path` works with `java.nio.file.Files` ([NIO file system provider](#nio-file-system-provider)) |
| `new FileInputStream(file)` | `file.getInputStream()` |
| `new FileOutputStream(file)`, `new FileOutputStream(file, true)` | `file.getOutputStream()`, `file.getOutputStream(true)` |
| `new FileReader(file, charset)` | `new FileSourceReader(file, charset)` |
| `new FileWriter(file, charset)` | `new FileSourceWriter(file, charset)` |
| `new FileWriter(file, charset, true)` (append) | `new OutputStreamWriter(file.getOutputStream(true), charset)` |
| `new RandomAccessFile(file, mode)` | `file.getRandomAccessStream(mode)` (see [Random access](#random-access)) |
| `Files.readAllBytes(file.toPath())` | Unchanged |
| `getTotalSpace()`, `getFreeSpace()`, `getUsableSpace()` | Same names. Real values for local files; 0 where the file system can't tell, which is what `java.io.File` returns in that case |
| `File.createTempFile(prefix, suffix)`, `File.createTempFile(prefix, suffix, dir)` | `factory.createTempFile(prefix, suffix)`, `factory.createTempFile(prefix, suffix, dir)`; also `factory.createTempDirectory(prefix)`. Without a directory they use `factory.getTempDirectory()`: `java.io.tmpdir` for local files, `/tmp` in memory, the current directory elsewhere unless the implementation overrides it |
| `file.deleteOnExit()` | Same name. Local files use `java.io.File.deleteOnExit()`. Other files are deleted when their factory disconnects, or at exit if it's still connected then (see [Behaviour worth knowing](#behaviour-worth-knowing)) |


### Example

Before:

```java
long totalLogSize(File dir) {
    long total = 0;
    File[] logs = dir.listFiles(f -> f.getName().endsWith(".log"));
    if (logs != null) {
        for (File f : logs) {
            total += f.length();
        }
    }
    return total;
}
```

After:

```java
long totalLogSize(FileSource dir) throws IOException {
    long total = 0;
    FileSource[] logs = dir.listFiles(f -> f.getName().endsWith(".log"));
    if (logs != null) {
        for (FileSource f : logs) {
            total += f.length();
        }
    }
    return total;
}
```

`FileSourceFilter` is a functional interface, so the lambda carries over unchanged. Its `getDescription()` (default "Filtered files") is only shown by the file chooser dialog; override it for filters you show there. One difference: `accept` can't throw `IOException`, so a filter that calls `isDirectory()`, `length()` and similar needs a `try`/`catch` inside the lambda.

The caller changes from `totalLogSize(new File("/var/log/app"))` to `totalLogSize(factory.createFileSource("/var/log/app"))`, and now works unchanged against a memory, FTP, SFTP or JDBC factory.

### Mixing both during a migration

You don't have to convert everything at once. At the boundary between converted and unconverted code:

```java
// java.io.File -> FileSource (local files)
FileSource fs = new FileProxy(file, FileSourceFactory.getDefaultFactory());
// or: FileSourceFactory.getDefaultFactory().createFileSource(file.getAbsolutePath())

// FileSource -> java.io.File (only meaningful for local files)
File back = (fs instanceof FileProxy) ? new File(fs.getAbsolutePath()) : null;
```

### Things that behave differently

- **Checked exceptions**: see step 4. A method that returned `false` for a missing file still does (`exists()`, `delete()`), but a failed connection is an `IOException` rather than a silent `false`.
- **`renameTo`** needs a destination from the same factory, returns `false` if the destination exists, and throws the underlying `IOException` for other failures, instead of returning `false` for everything.
- **`equals`** compares absolute paths within one implementation; a local `FileSource` never equals a memory one with the same path.
- **Remote calls cost time.** On FTP, SFTP or JDBC, `length()`, `lastModified()` and friends may each be a round trip. Keep results in a local variable inside loops instead of asking the same file repeatedly; call `refresh()` when you need fresh values.

### Testing converted code

Converted code can be tested against the in-memory file system instead of real directories:

```java
FileSourceFactory memory = FileSourceFactory.getFileSourceFactory("memory");
memory.connect();
FileSource dir = memory.createFileSource("/logs");
dir.mkdirs();
try (OutputStream out = dir.getChild("a.log").getOutputStream()) {
    out.write(new byte[100]);
}
assertEquals(100, totalLogSize(dir));
```

## Behaviour worth knowing

- `renameTo` never replaces an existing file: it returns `false` if the destination exists or belongs to another file system, and throws the underlying `IOException` for other failures. Use `Files.move(..., REPLACE_EXISTING)` to replace.
- In both built-in implementations, reading a file that doesn't exist throws `FileNotFoundException`, like `java.io`.
- `FileSource` objects are `Serializable` (both built-in implementations support it).
- `createTempFile` relies on `createNewFile()` to guarantee a unique name. That's atomic for local and memory files; on FTP it checks and then creates, so two clients could in principle pick the same random name at the same moment.
- `deleteOnExit()` on a non-local file deletes it when its factory's `disConnect()` runs, because that's the last point a remote connection is certainly open; a factory that is never disconnected has its files deleted by a shutdown hook, if it's still connected then. As with `java.io.File`, files are deleted newest registration first, a directory only if it's empty, and failures are ignored. Local files use `java.io.File.deleteOnExit()` and are deleted only at exit.

## Building and testing

```
mvn test
```

The tests use JUnit 5. A few only run on Windows, or when your user belongs to more than one group, and are skipped otherwise.

`mvn test` also measures test coverage with [JaCoCo](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/); open `target/site/jacoco/index.html` for the report.

## Why not just java.nio.file?

I was very excited when `java.nio.file.FileSystem` arrived in Java SE 7 (July 2011). But in my opinion its API is overly complex and nowhere near as simple as `java.io.File`, so it falls short of what I'd consider the minimal requirements. FileSource keeps the `java.io.File` style and still gives you a `java.nio.file` provider when you need one.
